\usage{
func.M(dat.tss, a, b, c = NULL, perturbation.presence = NULL,
  ncpu = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat.tss}{relative abundance matrix (each OTU in one row)}

\item{a}{estimated growth rate values (scaled by self-interaction)}

\item{b}{estimated interaction matrix (scaled by self-interaction)}

\item{c}{estimated external perturbation effect matrix (scaled by self-interaction)}

\item{perturbation.presence}{estimated external perturbation presence (not to be multiplied by 1/m) (each perturbation in one row, each sample in one column)}

\item{ncpu}{number of CPUs (default: 4)}
}
